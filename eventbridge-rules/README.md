# EventBridge Rules

This folder contains JSON event patterns and CloudFormation templates that define EventBridge rules.

## Purpose:
- Automatically trigger Lambda functions based on GuardDuty findings (e.g., EC2 compromise).
- Filter events by severity level and resource type.

These rules help automate threat response workflows in real-time.
